# Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Bare Metal Debugging

Example code and instructions for debugging Raspberry Pi 4 Model B bare metal programs.

I created this repo as an offshoot of my (AArch64OS)[https://github.com/dsmcfarl/aarch64os] project. I found there
wasn't great information about how to setup to debug a bare metal program on the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B using GDB and
JTAG. There were a lot of resources taht helped get JTAG working, but not much on how to actually setup a good work
flow. This repo is meant to help with that.
